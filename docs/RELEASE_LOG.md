# RELEASE LOG

## 2026-08-25 — RSS repository UI Beta 3

Status: Beta/Test; awaiting user real-device confirmation.

Changes:

- Investigated Beta 2 after the user reported that Home / Bundle / Help still failed while Stable/Beta loaded.
- Confirmed the HTTPS payload files themselves were valid.
- Identified the Beta 2 helper-context bug: nested `q() -> repo()` calls lost the expected `this.source` binding.
- Rebuilt Home / Bundle / Help as data-driven HTTPS lists with explicit `detailUrl` fields.
- Added independent HTTPS detail JSON files under `rss/data/details/`.
- Simplified the RSS list parser so all categories share one generic path.
- Removed dynamic helper chaining from category navigation.
- Kept the same internal Beta RSS `sourceUrl` identity so Beta 3 updates the existing Beta subscription.
- Repository icon remains at `assets/reader-repo-icon.jpg`.

Pending real-device verification:

- all five top categories,
- detail-page opening,
- icon display,
- RSS update action,
- bundle import action.

## 2026-08-25 — RSS repository UI Beta 2

Status: Beta/Test; superseded by Beta 3 after real-device failure.

Changes:

- Replaced Beta 1 `data:` category URLs with HTTPS payloads.
- Added repository icon asset.
- Added stable Legado source identity policy.

Real-device result:

- Stable/Beta categories loaded.
- Home / Bundle / Help still failed due to the helper-context bug later fixed in Beta 3.

## 2026-08-25 — RSS repository UI Beta preparation

Status: Beta/Test UI work; no book-source Stable release yet.

Completed:

- User switched GitHub default branch to neutral `landing`.
- Actual project and Raw distribution remain on `main`.
- Reviewed three reference RSS sources supplied by the user.
- Adopted a combined UI direction:
  - native Legado categories and list for browsing,
  - styled HTML detail page for metadata and import actions,
  - explicit Stable / Beta separation,
  - separate batch-import area,
  - no required remote-JS runtime dependency for the repository RSS source.

## 2026-08-25 — Repository foundation

Status: infrastructure / no book-source Stable release yet.

Completed:

- Created and connected `source-core-8d7` as the dedicated 阅读 / Legado repository.
- Established hard isolation from the 海阔视界 repository `asset-core-7f3`.
- Added repository-level Manifest skeleton.
- Added Stable and Beta subscription-channel skeletons.
- Added Stable and Beta batch Bundle skeletons.
- Added `🌈 阅读书源仓库` RSS source.
- Corrected the RSS import workflow.
- User confirmed the RSS source imports successfully in the real Legado app.
- Created a neutral `landing` branch and later made it the default branch.
- Added long-term project documents.

## Release policy

Future entries should clearly distinguish:

- generated / static-check passed,
- Beta/Test published,
- user real-device confirmed,
- Stable published.

A generated or statically validated version must not be logged as Stable unless the user has confirmed it or explicitly requested the stable update.
